# **🚀 Inception**

Welcome to **Inception**! 🎉  
This project is a deep dive into the world of **Docker** and **containerization**. The goal of this project is to use **Docker** to automate the deployment of various services, such as a **web server**, a **database**, and other necessary tools, all running in isolated containers. The challenge is to understand how to set up, configure, and communicate between multiple containers in a single environment using **Docker Compose**.

## 🔧 **What You'll Learn**
In this project, you will:
- **Create Dockerfiles** to define custom containers for different services 🐳.
- Use **Docker Compose** to manage multiple containers and orchestrate how they communicate with each other 🔗.
- Set up and configure a range of services like **NGINX**, **MySQL**, and **WordPress** 🛠️.
- Learn the basics of **containerization** and how it simplifies development and deployment 🧑‍💻.

## 🎯 **Objective**
The aim of **Inception** is to set up a fully working environment with various services running in containers. Here’s a quick overview of what needs to be done:
1. Set up a **MySQL** server in a container.
2. Create a **WordPress** site running inside a Docker container, and connect it to the MySQL database.
3. Set up an **NGINX** web server to serve the WordPress site.
4. Make sure everything is connected and configured to run smoothly together.
